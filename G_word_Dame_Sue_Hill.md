# GEL The G word
## Professor Dame Sue Hill: The Field of Genomics

- Currently at the most excting time for healthcare and science, especially from the view of COVID-19 and how the NHS and scientific community has responded to the pandemic
- Medicine should be evidence-based and there is a continuing need to move research and industry forward and integrate developments into healthcare
- Took on a lot of professional leadership roles; designing and implementing services and service improvements.
- Genomic medicine moved into mainstream healthcare, how did we get here from the Human Genome Project in 2002?
    - NHS had early focus on genetics. First genetic counsellign service set up in 1940s at GOSH
    - 1960s, NHS genetic labs were born, looking at whole genome chromosomal abnormalities
    - Sanger allowed us to look at genes rather than at the chromosome level
    - Human Genome Project allowed us to see how this sequencing could be used in the NHS

### GMS

- Fortunate that the government has a long-standing interest in genomics, which has allowed us to build an infrastructure for it in the NHS
- WGS was a different ballgame, hard to conceptualise start to end.
    - A lot of components couldn't be implemented until the GMS was launched
    - Resulted in the centralisation of services into genomic hubs
- Clinical genetics and counselling services needed to be able to support the 7 hubs, what woudl this look like and how would they work with other clinical services as well? How to work in a multi-disciplinary way and how to keep driving development forwards and integrating new developments and gathering new evidence
- Workforce is critical, recruitment, up-skilling and education of existing staff

### What patient issues does the GMS address?

- The mandated Genomic Test Directory which outlines eligibility for specific genomic tests (2018 launch)
- Expanded cancer testing, e.g. looking at changes in cancer tissues, not just looking for inherited variants (e.g. BRCA)
- We've moved from single gene testing to panel testing ('pan-cancer')
- Moving into pharmacogenomics in cancers (e.g. fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy agents and DPYD)
- Also looking into common diseases, e.g. familial hypercholesterolemia 
- Moving from predictive/prevention, into diagnosis/recurence, and then how we can personalise and target interventions
- Single-gene, polygenics, cancer, common diseases, pharmacogenomics
- Will genomics influence ALL aspects of medicine?
    - Will be used more an more in common diseases
    - How will it impact the diagnosis made, the treatment or intervention?
    - Will continue to expand, not to the whole of halthcare, but we have lots of scope for using it more for predictive/prevention (e.g. early cancer testing from blood)
    - WGS used to find exisitng diseases and find variants that may or may not be associated with a patient's presentation
- WGS changes how we manage the populaion and disease-focused healthcare

### Newborn sequencing, why? how?

- Public dialogue is incredibly important to developing these services and infrastructure
- Gives us the potential to look for rare diseases before age 5, and which have a poor outcome, and specifically for children who would otherwise require multiple hosptial admissions and interaction multiple disciplines before getting a diagnosis
    - Some of these diseases can't be treated, but can be used to inform intervention options and family planning
- Opportunity to see how WGS will link with current screening programmes
- Option to look at other conditions that present later, although this requires extensive discussions
- Can we create a pharmacogenomic profile at birth?
- When do we interrogate a genome for other diseases tha impact later in life
- Big questions requriing discussion, interaction with the public
- At the moment though, early childhood illnesses with treatment options

### Why is the UK doing well with genomics?

- Rich academic history, mentioned the UK BioBank
- Need to continue with a trusted research environment, where developments can be fed back into healthcare
    - This continual feedback loop is so important
- We have an integrated healthcare system. Genomics is seen as a core service within this.
- Also we have dedicated and passionate professionals in all aspects of genomics, in government, NHS E&I, and 'on the ground staff'
- We need to do more comms and spreading good news stories in particular, to inform the public about what we do and how it benefits the population
- We have something to tell, and we need to tell it - how we are helping *people*.

### How do we remain genomic global leaders?

- Ongoing investment at all levels, we need to do proof-of-concept studies, and also to be able to implement developments at the other end
    - Rapid adoption and implementation
    - An acceptance of the costs to this
- The 100k genomes project came out of the london olympics, and in 2017 the proposal was put forward for WGS in the NHS while the 100k g project was still ongoing
- Need to full engage the workforce, doctors, nurses, etc.
    - Commitment from Royal Colleges to work with GMS
    - Needs investment
    - What skills do we need to develop?
    - How do these staff contribute to genomics and what does genomics mean for their roles?
    - Champions and advocates for genomics medicine at all levels of healthcare
- To mainstream the NHS, we made the GMSAs which have multi-disciplinary leadership.

### Comms

- People are engaged by diverse patient stories
- We need to amplify the voices of patients primarily. Patients with genetic conditions or who have gone through genomic testing
- Need to engage parliamentarians
- Need an on-going dialogue with the general population and this is fed-up to a national level
